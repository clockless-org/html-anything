# html-anything

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/clockless-org/html-anything)](https://skills.sh/clockless-org/html-anything)

Turn files, folders, and URLs into one self-contained interactive HTML report.

It is not a format converter. The agent samples the source, finds the interesting structure, designs the right charts and views, then inlines the full data into a single live `.html` file you can open, email, or host as static HTML.

## Preview

- [Highlighted example: realistic couple chat report](https://clockless-org.github.io/html-anything/examples/wechat-couple/output.html)

[![Realistic couple chat report screenshot](./docs/relationship-preview.png)](https://clockless-org.github.io/html-anything/examples/wechat-couple/output.html)

The highlighted example uses a synthetic WeChat-style couple chat: 52K messages over two years, with quiet days, work delays, short replies, small arguments, repairs, images, voice notes, transfers, and anonymized evidence snippets.

## Install

### Codex

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
git clone https://github.com/clockless-org/html-anything "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/html-anything"
```

Restart Codex so it loads the skill.

### Claude Code

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/clockless-org/html-anything ~/.claude/skills/html-anything
```

Restart Claude Code so it loads `SKILL.md`.

### Agent Skills CLI

```bash
npx skills add clockless-org/html-anything
```

To update a manual install later:

```bash
git -C "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/html-anything" pull
```

## Use

Ask your agent in plain language:

```text
Use html-anything to convert ~/Downloads/_chat.txt into an interactive HTML page.
```

```text
Use html-anything on my Spotify history. Walk me through the export first.
```

```text
Make a one-page HTML dashboard from ./data/customers.csv.
```

If you name a source but do not have the file yet, the skill starts with export instructions first. For example: "my WeChat chat", "my WhatsApp chat", "my Spotify history", "my Google Maps stars", or "my Apple Health export".

The result is a live `.html` file, not markdown: inline CSS, inline JS, inline data, works offline by double-clicking.

## Standalone CLI

The CLI uses the same source pack as the skill. It accepts local files and directories; URL handling is better in skill mode because the agent can fetch and inspect the page first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clockless-org/html-anything
cd html-anything
npm install
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # or OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
npx tsx src/cli.ts examples/csv/input.csv --out /tmp/customers.html
```

## Defaults

- Outputs are single-file live HTML. No server required.
- Outputs work offline. Geo pages do not use map tiles.
- The generated HTML embeds source data client-side. Treat it as sensitive as the original export.
- Sensitive-record sources are for organization and review only, not medical, legal, tax, accounting, immigration, or insurance advice.
- The agent sees a representative sample; the full source data is injected afterward and rendered client-side.
